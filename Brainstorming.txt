Brainstorming Set Up

Call Class:
1.	Create Call objects with relevant data in the form Call(received time, response time, date, group, zip code)
2.	Call data members: hour, minute, second, dispatch time, time of day, day, group, zip code
3.	Adjust and compensate for missing data from calls that were not responded to
4.	Parse received and response times to produce hh:mm:ss format
5.	Use time to calculate and set time of day for each Call

CallAnalyzer Class:
1.	Has functions to read in .csv file and parse relevant data into list of call objects
2.	 Facilitate Data Visual functions

Data Visuals:
Calculate and show the frequency of dispatch to each zip code. 
1.	Call data used: zip code
2.	Iterate through the list of calls to calculate the occurrences of each zip code
3.	Iterate though map to rank zip codes. This will be slow so a StringBuffer will be used instead of String to increase performance

Calculate the average response time for each call type group.
1.	Call data used: group, 
2.	Helper function to count occurrences of each type of group
3.	Calculate total dispatch time, from when the call is received to when the response has been sent, divide by number of occurrences

Calculate the difference between response time for Late Night, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening, every day of the week
1.	Call data used: dispatch time, day, time of day, 
2.	Set TreeMap keys equal to day and time of day so that it is possible to parse the key and obtain both data members separately
