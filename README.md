# capital-one-challenge
My submission to part 2 of the 2018 Capital One Software Engineering Summit application

Challenge Description:

An increase in a city's population surges the number of emergency call volume and response rate. 
Additionally, the services that are dispatched for various calls need to look for trends in order 
to be better prepared in the case of an emergency.

For this challenge, we're providing you with public data from the San Francisco Fire Department 
that contains dispatch information for emergency calls, with call time, location, and dispatch.

This challenge closes March 25th. 

To solve this challenge, build a web application or web page that provides:

Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
Given an address and time, what is the most likely dispatch to be required?
Which areas take the longest time to dispatch to on average? How can this be reduced?

Deliverables:

(Optional) Bonus features:

Heat maps: Add heat maps that show dispatch frequency, urgency over the city.
Crime correlation: Based on the type of dispatch and the frequency of dispatch, show the most calm and safe neighborhoods in the city
Preparing for the future: Which areas are experiencing the greatest increase in dispatch calls? Where and what type of dispatch service would you place to help with the rate of increasing calls?
Adding bonus features may help distinguish you from other submissions.

Submissions will be graded on the following criteria:
Meets Deliverables
Creativity / Aesthetics (think UI / UX)
Code Quality & Clarity (code structure, comments, readability, etc.)
